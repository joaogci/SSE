&Lattice
p  = P_R   ! The lattice is made of "p"-gons
q  = Q_R   ! Coordination number of the lattice
nl = Nl_R   ! Depth of the lattice, i.e. number of layers
/

&Simulation
beta          = Beta_R       ! Inverse temperature
epsilon       = 0.25      ! Constant to make the vertices weight bigger than zero
therm_cycles  = NT_R      ! Number of thermalization cycles
n_bins        = NB_R        ! Number of bins 
mc_sweeps     = NSW_R     ! Number of measurement cycles per bin
/

&Hamiltonian
S               = S_R
J_perp          = J_perp_R
J_par           = J_par_R
