&Lattice
Lx                  = Lx_R   ! Number of unit lattices on the x direction
Ly                  = Ly_R   ! Number of unit lattices on the x direction
boundary_condition  = BC_R    ! Boundary condition: P for PBC or O for OBC
/

&Simulation
beta          = Beta_R       ! Inverse temperature
epsilon       = 0.25      ! Constant to make the vertices weight bigger than zero
therm_cycles  = NT_R      ! Number of thermalization cycles
n_bins        = NB_R        ! Number of bins 
mc_sweeps     = NSW_R     ! Number of measurement cycles per bin
/

&Hamiltonian
S               = S_R
J_perp          = J_perp_R
J_par           = J_par_R
magnetic_field  = H_R
crystal_field   = D_R
