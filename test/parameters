&Lattice
p  = 8   ! The lattice is made of "p"-gons
q  = 3   ! Coordination number of the lattice
nl = 1   ! Depth of the lattice, i.e. number of layers
/

&Simulation
beta          = 1.0       ! Inverse temperature
epsilon       = 0.25      ! Constant to make the vertices weight bigger than zero
therm_cycles  = 1000      ! Number of thermalization cycles
n_bins        = 10        ! Number of bins 
mc_sweeps     = 10000     ! Number of measurement cycles per bin

&Hamiltonian
S               = 0.5
J_perp          = 1.0
J_par           = 1.0
